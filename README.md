# 🎸 Game Description:

Calling all Dead Heads! Test your memory with the DEAD HEAD MEMORY GAME. In this memory game, you will be playing against the computer to match up 6 possible pairs of cards containing The Grateful Dead album covers. When the cards are all matched, the player with the most pairs will be declared the winner.

# 🤔 What I would do differently now: 
 
* I would implement a framework or library, like React or Vue, to create a library of reusable components and manage state.
* I would use Sass to implement mixins and functions.

* If either player matches a pair of cards, their score gains one point. 
* This process will repeat itself until all 6 pairs are matched. 
* When all the cards are matched, the player with the most matching pairs is declared the winner. 
* After each round, the user will be asked if they want to play again.
